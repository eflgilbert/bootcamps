## QGIS

QGIS is an open source software for geospatial analysis and visualization. THe course I wook was available through LinkedIn Learning. It covers the following topics:
### Vector Data 
   Introduces the basic sources of data fir QGIS suck as databases, shapefiles (.shp), and WEB Feature Services (WFS). THese can all add attributes to a coordinate system.
### Raster Data
  Demonstrates use of 2-dimentional data in three forms. The first is enhanced compressed wavelet (ECW), a compace datatype file which can represent an image. Web map service (WMS) files can stream images from a remote server directly into QGIS. Finally, digital elevation model (DEM) rasters contain elevation values at each point, and can be used to create, among other things, contour maps. THe importance of matching coordinate systems between layers is emphasized int his section.
### 3D Maps
  QGIS can create 3D maps by draping an image across a DEM layer. These maps can be printed as is or converted into an animation.
  
### Other Exercises not included in this repository
- Stylizing data such as points, lines, and labels in order to make maps more readable
- Creating new datafiles from a QGIS project
- Advanced Tools (Overlay analysis, heatmaps from points, centroids from polygons)
- Using Plugins (Streetview and qgis2web)
- Python in QGIS (console and scripts)
