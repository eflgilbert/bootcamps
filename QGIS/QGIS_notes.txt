Vector
- Adding vector layers as files Directories, Databases, or links

Database
  - https://lnkd.in/ga_seqg (crime reporting)
	- Shapefile (.shp) can drag and drop or browse
	- Buildings 

Shapefiles
	-Parcels, easements, Intesections, ROad centerlines
	- Keep legend order in mind for visibility


- WFS WEb feature Services Data.
	- Hawaii, download APIs from hawaii.gov
- start with XYZ open streetmap zoom to hawaii
	- Maui roads https://geodata.hawaii.gov/arcgis/services/Transportation/MapServer/WFSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WFS
	- Kahoolawe contours 100ft
		-Lanai and Kahoolawe
	- Can query attributes from the database.

___________	

Rasters
- Open a file or link
- ECW, enhanced compressed wavelet
	- smaller datatype file
	- images can be georeferenced within the ECW file
	Make sure all the coordinate systems match up

- WMS
	- Web-based protocol that can stream images from a server to QGIS
	-Renders on the server then streams a raster image
	- Didn't change these files

- DEM - Digital elevation model
	-Raster that has elevations at each point. Can be made from LIDAR for elevation or from orthoimagery
	_Can style and blend images together by setting the greyscale ranges to be equivalent.

- Creating Contours
  Raster>Extraction>Contour

- Creating 3d Maps
	- Can use the online projection
	-Can use hidden DEM layer
	- Change the scale to observe vertical spaces in greater detail

- 3D Animations
	-After selectin animation, there is a standard pan backwards from location
	- You can set target points for whatever timestamp during the animation you want
	- Saving it outputs all of the frames
	- Recommended use Handbrake (I may use R in the future) to greate video or gif 
	- For 2D animation, just make an animation from directly above the 3D map

Styling data
-Point layers
	-Can stylize points by doing things such as changing the icon
	- IMport an svg (like clip art) as a custom icon
	- Set Unit to map units to keep the symbols the same size when zooming
